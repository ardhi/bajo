# Contribution

Thank you very much to those of you who want to join as contributors, but I have committed to devoting 100% of my time to this project. Therefore, I am currently unable to accept pull requests from anyone until the project becomes large enough for me to manage it independently.

However, I am always available if you encounter any bugs that require immediate fixes. Please report your issues in a GitHub issue, and I will try to address them promptly.

I am also open to suggestions for improvements or requests for new features.

## Donations
