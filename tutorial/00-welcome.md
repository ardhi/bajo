# Welcome

Bajo is one of a kind framework. Think of it as Lego blocks; you create your very own customized structure by attaching together only the needed blocks. This same principle for app building is now possible with Bajo: pick the right plugins, glue them together, and fire it up!

From a simple command-line app to a monster-sized, multi-page web app, Bajo will deliver your app in no time just by adding more plugins.

## About These Docs

If you're new to the Bajo Framework, please visit the *Getting Started* documentation. It will guide you step-by-step through many hands-on examples of Bajo's way of building a modular application.

The *User Guide* documentation gives you more in-depth information about the philosophy, app lifecycle, and the inner workings of a Bajo-based app. While the *Developer Guide* is written specifically for those who want to extend Bajo to the max by creating their own plugins.

## Contribution

Thanks very much to everyone who wants to join as a contributor, but I have committed to devoting 100% of my time to this project. Therefore, I'm currently unable to accept pull requests from anyone until the project is large enough for me to manage it independently.

However, I am available if you encounter any bugs that require immediate fixes. Please report your issues in a GitHub issue, and I'll try to address them promptly. I'm also open to criticism and suggestions for improvements or requests for new features.
